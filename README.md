-**Increase Revenue**: Minimize revenue loss caused by cancellations and improve yearly income generation.

-**Optimize Room Utilization**: Ensure better occupancy rates by reducing the number of vacant rooms resulting from cancellations.

## Conclusion
- Cancellation rates rise as the price does. In order to prevent cancellations of reservations, 
hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels 
based on locations. They can also provide some discounts to the consumers.
 
- As the ratio of the cancellation and not cancellation of the resort hotel is higher in the 
resort hotel than the city hotels. So the hotels should provide a reasonable discount on the 
room prices on weekends or on holidays.
